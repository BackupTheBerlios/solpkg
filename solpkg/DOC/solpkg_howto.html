<h1>Solaris Package System How-To Guide</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Solaris Package System ("solpkg") is a framework and
repository of Makefile "recipes" that can be used to build Solaris
packages out of software source tarballs. It supplies the missing
link between widely available source and Solaris binaries.</p>

<p>solpkg is essentially a clone of <a href=
"http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>'s ports system, which the
author worked on writing ports for for awhile. It is not as
complete but is more than adequate for building commonly used free
software packages for Solaris.</p>

<p>It was designed to have a minimal dependency on non-Solaris
tools. It is developed using Solaris' <code>make</code> tool, and
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a>'s <a href=
"http://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a>.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Before you can use solpkg, you'll need GCC. Precompiled packages
(which you can <code>gunzip</code> then install with <code>pkgadd
-d <var>name-of-package-file</var></code> are available from <a
href="ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/solpkg/">the solpkg FTP site</a>,
for several flavors of Solaris.</p>

<p>If you want to stay up-to-date with solpkg, you should also grab
a precompiled package of <a href="http://www.cvshome.org/">CVS</a>.
With this, you can update your copy of solpkg from the CVS
repository on <a href="http://developer.berlios.de/">BerliOS</a>.
If you don't need this, or you can't get through to the CVS pserver
(port 2401 on <code>cvs.solpkg.berlios.de</code>), you can get a
tarball from <a href=
"http://developer.berlios.de/projects/solpkg/">the solpkg project
page</a> instead.</p>

<p>(While you're at BerliOS, join the mailing list. You can keep
up-to-date with the project there, and join in the development if
you wish.)</p>

<p>If you got a tarball, extract it into an area with enough space
to hold the tarballs, extracts, and final packages for whatever
packages you want to use. solpkg itself is very small, but the
packages it builds can take several megabytes from start to finish.
If you choose to use CVS, follow the same guidelines, except you
want to follow <a href=
"http://developer.berlios.de/cvs/?group_id=268">the checkout
instructions on BerliOS</a> to get your solpkg work area ready to
go.</p>

<p>Finally, you'll need to make sure you have Solaris
<code>make</code> and packaging tools available on your system.
<code>make</code> is available in the <code>SUNWsprot</code>
package. The rest come in <code>SUNWcsu</code>, so you should
already have them. Add <code>/usr/ccs/bin</code> to your PATH, so
that <code>make</code> can be used.</p>

<h2>Building a package</h2>

<p>Once you've satisfied the prerequisites, building the packages
is very easy. First, you'll need to grab the source tarball, as
solpkg doesn't currently do it for you. Look at the Makefile in the
directory of the package you wish to install to figure out what
version you need (in this example, we'll be using
<code>gtar</code>, so type <code>cd solpkg/gtar</code>, then
<code>more Makefile</code>). Put it in the <code>DIST</code>
directory underneath your <code>solpkg</code> directory.</p>

<p>Now, switch to your package directory (<code>cd ../gtar</code>)
and type <code>make</code>. You don't have to be root for this
step, because all you are doing is compiling the source itself.</p>

<p>When the compilation is complete, <code>su</code> to root and
type <code>make package</code>, and you will get a package file
(extension <code>.pkg</code>) in the package directory.
<code>pkgadd -d <var>name-of-package-file</var></code> this, and
the package is installed! You can also reuse this package file on
any other system.</p>

<p>If compilation or packaging stops for any reason, you may need
to clean out the build or fake install area. There are two special
targets for this. <code>make clean-fake</code> cleans out the fake
area. <code>make clean</code> cleans out all fake and build
artifacts. Neither one deletes the package file, if one was
created.</p>

<h2>Building other packages</h2>

<p>Most package-building logic is abstracted into the
<code>GLOBAL/global.mk</code> file, which is included by the recipe
<code>Makefile</code>s. This makes the recipe
<code>Makefile</code>s able to stay simple, and override parts of
the process they need to handle quirks in a particular package's
build process.</p>

<p>If you have an upgrade to a package, it is usually as simple as
bumping the version number in the package's <code>Makefile</code>.
Then download the new source tarball into <code>DIST</code>, and
try to build a package.</p>

<p>When testing new builds, it is a good idea to never
<code>su</code> to root, and to use the <code>make prototype</code>
target instead of <code>make package</code>. When you do this, the
package-building stops when the <code>Prototype</code> file is
created, and you can check it to make sure that all the files would
be installed in the proper places, without risking a broken
installer installing rogue files all over your system.</p>

<p>If you want to bring new packages to solpkg, we welcome
submissions! If you can't figure out exactly what you need to do
from reading the source of other packages and
<code>global.mk</code>, contact the <a href=
"https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/solpkg-devel">solpkg-devel</a>
mailing list, and help can be provided.</p>
