When this package was upgraded to 3.2.3, it began to require gmake
instead of Solaris make, in addition to a working compiler to
bootstrap.

If your Solaris package came with a "Software Companion CD", you can
install gcc and gmake from there.  (If you do this, add /opt/sfw/bin to
your PATH before starting this build.)

The environment variable CC should be set to point to the compiler you
will be using to bootstrap.

If you're using a default INSTALL_PREFIX, /usr/lib/charset.alias will
end up conflicting with the one from SUNWgnome-base-libs.  Both files'
content are identical, save comments.
